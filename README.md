# Summary
In this assignment you will use your basic graph data structure to solve an important graph problem. Write a Java program that implements Dijkstra's single source shortest path algorithm. The algorithm will use as input two things:
  * a connected directed graph with weights on the edges (it may have cycles)
  * a single vertex, the start vertex
For each vertex V in the graph, Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from the start vertex to V (including start vertex to itself, with path length 0).

# Miscellaneous Notes
* You may use the Java collections library for queues, stacks, lists, etc. that you need to program this solution.
* You will also need a priority queue (binary min heap) to make the algorithm efficient; you may use the one in the Java library, but I would encourage you to get wild and use your own code from the Assignment 3.
